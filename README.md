## **Abortion Data Analysis using Bayesian Inference**

Coming from a country where abortion is illegal to the United States of America where abortion is legal (per state), hence, I assume that the legality of abortion will make the abortion rate high. In this project, I’m interested in studying abortion in the USA over the last few years. I will be using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to analyze this claim because the MCMC methods helps me to approximate the posterior distribution of the abortion rate by random sampling in a probabilistic space. In this project, I will study the differences in the abortion rate in the United States of America from 2015 – 2020 and determine if truly, there is a significant increase or decrease in successive years. This analysis will be used to validate or disprove my initial claim.

Data Source: The data for this analysis was gotten from Johnson’s archive which feeds from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) database. The data contains the number of abortions in the 50 states in the USA plus the District of Columbia.

# **The questions that will be answered are:**
  1.  Is there a difference in the mean number of abortions in the USA from 2015 to 2016?
  2.  Is there a difference in the mean number of abortions in the USA from 2017 to 2018?
  3.  Is there a difference in the mean number of abortions in the USA from 2019 to 2020?
