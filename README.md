# **Abortion Data Analysis using Bayesian Inference**

Coming from a nation where abortion is illegal to the United States of America, where abortion is legal (by state), I expect that the legality of abortion will lead to an increase in the abortion rate. In this research, I'm looking into abortion in the United States during the previous few years. I will investigate this claim using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach since it allows me to approximate the posterior distribution of the abortion rate using random sampling in a probabilistic space. In this research, I will look at the differences in the abortion rate in the United States of America from 2015 to 2020 to see if there is a substantial rise or reduction over time.

This analysis will be used to support or refute my first assertion.

**Data Source:** The data for this analysis was gotten from Johnsonâ€™s archive which feeds from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) database. The data contains the number of abortions in the 50 states in the USA plus the District of Columbia.

## **The questions that will be answered are:**
  1.  Is there a difference in the mean number of abortions in the USA from 2015 to 2016?
  2.  Is there a difference in the mean number of abortions in the USA from 2017 to 2018?
  3.  Is there a difference in the mean number of abortions in the USA from 2019 to 2020?
  
## **Analysis and Conclusion**
According to the findings of the study, there is no clear evidence to support my argument that the abortion rate in the United States of America is high. Abortion rates in 2015 were most likely higher than those in 2016. This finding is supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) 2016 abortion report. "From 2015 to 2016, the total number of reported abortions declined by 2% (from 636,902), the abortion rate decreased by 2% (from 11.8 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years), and the abortion ratio decreased by 1% (from 188 abortions per 1,000 live births)," according to the data.

Similarly, abortion rates in 2017 were most likely lower than abortion rates in 2018. This finding is supported by the 2018 CDC abortion report. According to the report, "from 2017 to 2018, the total number of abortions and abortion rate climbed 1% (from 609,095 total abortions and 11.2 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years, respectively), and the abortion ratio increased 2% (from 185 abortions per 1,000 live births).

Finally, the abortion rate in 2019 is likely to be greater than the abortion rate in 2020. This finding is supported by the CDC's 2020 abortion report. According to the report, "from 2019 to 2020, the total number of abortions declined 2% (from 625,346 total abortions), the abortion rate fell 2% (from 11.4 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years), and the abortion ratio increased 2% (from 195 abortions per 1,000 live births). As time passes and additional evidence becomes available, I will be able to retest my initial assertion.
